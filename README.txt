Find the longest string which matches longest prefix
This is implemented using device and concure algorith which will do it in nlogn times.

Below is the example for running it
1) First argument is file with the words and each on new line
2) Second argument is the input string to match prefix

go run main.go ~/test/longest_prefix_string/sample_prefix.txt 4v
